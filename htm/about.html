<h1>Mission</h1>
<p>NextClimate empowers individuals, communities, and organizations to <i>take action</i> on climate change. We accomplish this in several ways. For example, we demystify the various technical and financial aspects of residential solar installations through presentations offered at community centers. We make it cost-effective for home-owners to go solar through tiered group discounts; and, where solar is not the best option, connect them with trusted energy-efficiency services and/or suggest other alternatives to contribute to the growth and spread of renewable energy. Finally, we inspire the next generation of green innovators at local schools by showcasing the latest research and advances in clean technologies.</p>
