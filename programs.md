Our Solarize programs organize people together for group discounts on
home solar. We make it easier, by offering free solar assessments from
vetted installers, and more affordable, by offering a pre-negociated
price on industry-standard panels. In the past year, we have organized
5 Solarize campaigns, 1,300 people have enrolled for a free home
assessment and more than 100 people have switched to solar.

### Solar for Schools ###

For every home that goes solar, we set aside funds towards building an
educational solar installation. In the fall of 2014 we built a
learning solar installation at McDougle Middle School, and are
scheduled to build another at Carrboro High School in the Fall of
2015.
