### About us ###

NextClimate is a non-profit organization that helps people take action
on climate change in ways that strengthen communities. 

Making your home more efficient or switching to solar is a great way
to save on your electricity bill and get rid of pollution from power
plants. We make it easy by organizing people together for group
discounts on home energy improvements.

Equally important is educating the next generation of energy
inventors. We build learning solar installations at local schools and
develop after school curriculum for community centers.
